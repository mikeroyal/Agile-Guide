# Agile-Guide

## A guide that covers Agile Methodologies, Disciplines, and Certifications that make managing development Teams more efficiently and effectively. 

[Scrum](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum) is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.
    
[Lean](https://resources.collab.net/agile-101/agile-methodologies) is an agile methodology that eliminates waste through such practices as selecting only the truly valuable features for a system, prioritizing those selected, and delivering them in small batches. It emphasizes the speed and efficiency of development workflow, and relies on rapid and reliable feedback between programmers and customers. Lean uses the idea of work product being "pulled" via customer request. It focuses decision-making authority and ability on individuals and small teams, since research shows this to be faster and more efficient than hierarchical flow of control. Lean also concentrates on the efficiency of the use of team resources, trying to ensure that everyone is productive as much of the time as possible. It concentrates on concurrent work and the fewest possible intra-team workflow dependencies. Lean also strongly recommends that automated unit tests be written at the same time the code is written. 
    
[Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban) is a scheduling system for lean manufacturing and just-in-time manufacturing. Like Scrum, Kanban is a process designed to help teams work together more effectively.
    
[Kanban board](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards) is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). Kanban boards use cards, columns, and continuous improvement to help technology and service teams commit to the right amount of work, and get it done!
    
[Dynamic System Development Model, (DSDM)](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/dynamic-systems-development-method/) is an agile framework that addresses the entire project lifecycle and its impact on the business. Like the broader agile philosophy, DSDM is an iterative approach to software development, and this framework explicitly states “any project must be aligned to clearly defined strategic goals and focus upon early deliver of real benefits to the business.” The framework is built on four principles: feasibility and business study, functional model and prototype iteration, design and build iteration, and implementation.
    
[Extreme Programming (XP)](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/xp/) is an agile software development framework that aims to produce higher quality software, and higher quality of life for the development team. XP is the most specific of the agile frameworks regarding appropriate engineering practices for software development.
    
[Crystal](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/crystal-agile-framework/) is an agile framework focusing on individuals and their interactions, as opposed to processes and tools. In other words, this framework is a direct outgrowth of one of the core values articulated in the [Agile Manifesto](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/).The Crystal agile framework is built on two core beliefs:

    Teams can find ways on their own to improve and optimize their workflows
    
    Every project is unique and always changing, which is why that project’s team is best suited to determine how it will tackle the work

[Adaptive software development (ASD)](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/adaptive-software-development/) is a direct outgrowth of an earlier agile framework, Rapid Application Development (RAD). It aims to enable teams to quickly and effectively adapt to changing requirements or market needs by evolving their products with lightweight planning and continuous learning.
    
[Disciplined agile delivery](https://www.pmi.org/disciplined-agile/process/introduction-to-dad) is a people-first, learning-oriented hybrid agile approach to IT solution delivery. It has a risk-value delivery lifecycle, is goal-driven, is enterprise aware, and is scalable.
    
[Feature-driven development (FDD)](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/feature-driven-development/) is an agile framework that, as its name suggests, organizes software development around making progress on features. Features in the FDD context, though, are not necessarily product features in the commonly understood sense. 
    
[Scrumban](https://www.agilealliance.org/what-is-scrumban/) is an Agile management methodology that combines hybrids of Scrum and Kanban together. It was originally designed as a way to transition from Scrum to Kanban.
    
[Kanplan](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/kanplan) is a mixed methodology for practicing agile software development. Like scrumban, it combines features from both scrum and kanban. Kanplan is ideal for teams who want the ability to backlog groom, but don't want to work in sprints.
    
[RAD(Rapid Application Development)](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/rapid-application-development/)  is an agile framework focused primarily on rapid prototyping of software products, frequently iterating based on feedback, and continuously releasing updated versions of those products to the market.

### Certifications

[Project Management Professional (PMP)](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/types/project-management-pmp) certification tells employers, peers, and the world you know what you’re doing in project management.

[Program Management Professional (PgMP)](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/types/program-management-pgmp) is a visible sign of your advanced experience and skill and gives you a distinct advantage in employment and promotion.

[Portfolio Management Professional (PfMP)](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/types/portfolio-management-pfmp) signifies your advanced competency in the coordinated management of one or more portfolios to achieve strategic objectives. 

[PMI Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP)](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/types/agile-acp) formally recognizes your knowledge of agile principles and your skill with agile techniques. Show your peers, employers, and stakeholders that your agile knowledge runs deep.

[PMI Risk Management Professional (PMI-RMP)](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/types/risk-management-rmp) highlights your ability to identify and assess project risks, mitigate threats and capitalize on opportunities. In this capacity, you enhance and protect the needs of your organization.

[Disciplined Agilist (DA)](https://disciplinedagileconsortium.org/DA) indicates to colleagues and employers that you have taken some initial steps to learn about Disciplined Agile. 

[Certified Disciplined Agilist (CDA)](https://disciplinedagileconsortium.org/CDA) indicates to colleagues and employers that you have fundamental knowledge about Disciplined Agile strategies and that you are eager to learn and increase your skills and abilities as a software professional.

[Certified Disciplined Agile Practitioner (CDAP)](https://disciplinedagileconsortium.org/CDAP) indicates that you are experienced at agile solution delivery and are on your way to becoming a generalizing specialist. You have the potential to be a “junior coach” under the guidance of a senior coach.

[Disciplined Agile Lean Scrum Master (DALSM)](https://disciplinedagileconsortium.org/DA-Lean-Scrum-Master) training and certification provides tools and strategies to help you lead an agile team, influence people, remove impediments and to tailor your team’s way of working (WoW) so it matches and reflects the unique situation of your unique team.
